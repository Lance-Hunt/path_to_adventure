This is your home. You live here. It is a thatched-roof cottage in a 
magical land of mystery and adventure. You hear the call of adventure 
calling you. Get ready for your adventure.

> To start, CREATE A TEXT FILE here called "name.txt" with your name in it. 
  Bonus points if you can do it without using a text editor like nano.

> During your adventures, you will encounter treasure. Find all the treasure and 
  bring it back here. You'll need somewhere to put your treasure, though, so 
  CREATE A DIRECTORY named "treasure_chest" right here in your cottage.

> Now explore the path that lies before you. Use the commands "cd", "ls", and "pwd"
  among others to navigate this world of adventure. Start by leaving home by typing
  "cd leave_home" at the prompt. 
  
> Each time you enter a new location, check to see if there is a README with "cat README"
