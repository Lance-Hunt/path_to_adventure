The frog says, "Hey! My name is Elkimer. I've been cursed by 
my stupid brother. He was supposed to hit me with a wand that 
gives me beautiful hair, but he grabbed the wrong wand. I've 
been stuck at this stupid pond ever since. Please change me back."

(Rename this file to a file with the frog's true name. It should be in all lower case.)
