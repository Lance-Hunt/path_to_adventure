The desert is hot and dry, like a barren area of landscape where little precipitation occurs 
and, consequently, living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. You do see some
watering holes, though. At least you think you do. The younger ones seem to be mirages, though.
Only touch the oldest of the watering holes, and you will get your reward.

(Determine the oldest watering hole and use the touch command on it. DO NOT TOUCH ANY OTHER WATERING HOLES!)
